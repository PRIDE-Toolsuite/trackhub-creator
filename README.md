# Overview
# How to set up the application
This application counts on a _Makefile_ for doing a lot of DevOps related heavy lifting.

There are two main installation targets:
- _install_, this is the usual installation target used when preparing a development setup of the application, or a production installation that doesn't have into account the possible presence of an HPC environment.
A _Python virtual environment_ will be prepared with all the application requirements, also, external tools needed by the application will be collected and made available.
- _install_lsf_, like the other installation target, this one will do the same, but taking into account the possible presence of an HPC environment.
